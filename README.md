The dataset folder contains roughly 4000 images sorted in two folders train and test.

# Requirements:
1. Python
2. Keras
3. Tensorflow
4. Django

# Training the model
The CNN model can be trained directly or its parameters can be tuned for better accuracy.
The folder also contains a pre trained model with .h5 extention which can be used directly.
